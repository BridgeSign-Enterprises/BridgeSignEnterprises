  <!-- ABOUT SECTION -->
  <section id="about" aria-labelledby="about-title">
    <h2 id="about-title">About BridgeSign Enterprises</h2>
    <p>
      BridgeSign Enterprises is a pioneering organization committed to removing communication barriers between the deaf and hearing communities.
      We believe that communication is a fundamental human right, and no one should be excluded due to lack of accessible resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our vision is to create a world without communication gaps, where technology, education, and empathy work together to promote
      equality, inclusion, and understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      We achieve this by developing deaf-friendly digital platforms, providing educational resources, hosting awareness campaigns,
      and working hand-in-hand with the community to ensure every voice — spoken or signed — is heard and valued.
    </p>

  <!-- FEATURES SECTION -->
  <section id="features" aria-labelledby="features-title">
    <h2 id="features-title">Key Accessibility Features</h2>
    <p>
      BridgeSign Enterprises integrates cutting-edge accessibility features to ensure that people who are deaf or hard of hearing 
      can engage, learn, and participate equally. We follow global standards like WCAG and also gather direct feedback from our users
      to continuously improve accessibility.
    </p>
    <ul class="feature-list">
      <li><strong>Accurate Captions & Subtitles:</strong> All video and audio content is equipped with precisely synced captions 
        that not only display spoken words but also describe important non-verbal audio cues such as background sounds, laughter, or music tones.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Sign Language Support:</strong> Key resources and service explanations include sign language interpretations 
        in multiple variants (ASL, BSL, ISL) so that users can receive information in their preferred visual language.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Text Transcripts:</strong> Every audio-based content format — including podcasts, interviews, and training modules —
        is transcribed so users can read instead of listening, or use screen readers effectively.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Visual Alerts:</strong> System messages, notifications, and important events are accompanied by high-visibility pop-ups 
        and icons so no auditory alert goes unnoticed.
      </li>
      <li><strong>User-Friendly Navigation:</strong> Menus and content are organized in a clean, logical order, with search functionality 
        to help users quickly find what they need, even with varying literacy levels.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Multiple Communication Channels:</strong> Users can interact via live chat, text messaging, or other non-voice methods, 
        ensuring everyone can connect.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Compliance & Testing:</strong> The platform is regularly audited with assistive technologies and user feedback sessions 
        to maintain the highest accessibility standards.
      </li>
    </ul>
